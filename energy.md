# Energy

*I'd love whatever you have on renewable energies and energy distribution based on time, location, source etc. We're studying renewable energies and each student has a focus of either wind, solar, hydro or fuel cell technologies*

This looks cool, but there I found there to be a confusing disconnect. Homes that look very different on the map (shady smaller roofs vs large sunny ones) had fairly similar 20-year savings rates. The main difference seems to be that even if the roof is much larger, they're only recommending an installation just large enough to cover the current estimated energy bill. 

So, while it looks shiny & cool, the calculation actually seems to have little to do with the usable hours of sunlight or the square feet available. But, rather, is mostly determined by your current energy bill, which drives how many solar panels you buy, which determines your upfront costs. This also assumes that you can't get money back for energy sent into the grid, which might incentivize installing a larger set of panels than to just cover your needs. 

It also doesn't get into trade-offs between peak energy usage and size of installation, etc.
